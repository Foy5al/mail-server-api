# Mail Server API - An Alternative to Email JS

Mail Server API is a Node.js based project that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for sending emails with attachments or just the mail body using your own email configuration. This project is designed as an alternative to Email JS, allowing developers to send emails programmatically using their own email servers and configurations.

The Mail Server API is built using Node.js and provides a RESTful API interface for sending emails. It supports business emails for now. The API also supports sending attachments(maximum 5 files with in 20mb limit) with emails, making it an ideal solution for developers who need to send files via email.

With Mail Server API, users can integrate email functionality into their applications with ease. The project is open source and available on GitHub, making it easy for developers to contribute to the project and add new features. In future I will add Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook, and allows users to customize the email content, subject, and recipients.

## Features

- Easy-to-use RESTful API for sending emails
- Ability to send emails with attachments or just the mail body
- Open source project on GitHub
- Support all business emails

## Installation

No installation required. Simply send a POST request to the API endpoint using the appropriate tools and parameters.

## Usage/Examples

```javascript
To use the API, simply make a POST request to the /send endpoint with the necessary parameters, including the email content, subject, and recipients. If you want to send an attachment, you can include the file as a base64 encoded string in the request body.
```

Mail Server API is an open source project. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Your contributions will be reviewed and merged into the project if they meet the project's standards.
